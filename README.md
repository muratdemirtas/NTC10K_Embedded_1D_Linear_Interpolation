You can use this example code on microcontrollers like STM32, NXP etc.

10K NTC sensor used in this example. 


If you want to reach maximum resolution then you have to increase interpolation table size.

I compiled this on Eclipse and after i ported to my project. You can test this algorithm on your computer easily.
